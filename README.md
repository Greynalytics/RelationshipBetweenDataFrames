## Correlation between Variables in a Data Frame 

### Introduction

In this project, I demonstrated my knowledge in analysing correlations. Two In- built R Data set were used to conduct this analysis. "Iris" and "Mtcars"

iris is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables (columns) named Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species. iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

The Mtcars data frame has 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

[, 1]	mpg	Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders
[, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower
[, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	wt	Weight (1000 lbs)
[, 7]	qsec	1/4 mile time
[, 8]	vs	Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
[, 9]	am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10]	gear	Number of forward gears
[,11]	carb	Number of carburetors

### Questions

1. Using the Mtcars Data Investigate the relationship between weight and miles per gallon and also between weight and the quarter miles time (seconds).

  Weight is the predictor variable for both analyses, with miles per gallon and quarter mile time as the respective response variables. Both relationships should be   fully investigated using the appropriate screening checks, correct analytical methods and be fully reported in the annotations with the correct figures               represented. Results should be written up in the annotations in the manner that you would present in a scientific report ensuring the relationship is described.     Ensure that all null hypotheses tested are reported in the annotations.
 
2. Using the Iris data Investigate the relationship between sepal length and sepal width of setosa species.

   Sepal length is the predictor variable with sepal width as the response variable. The relationships should be fully investigated using the appropriate screening      checks, correct analytical method and be fully reported in the annotations with the correct figure represented. Results should be written up in the annotations in    the manner that you would present in a scientific report ensuring the relationship is described. Ensure that all null hypotheses tested, are reported fully in the    annotations.
